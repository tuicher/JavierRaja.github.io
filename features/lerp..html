                    <h2> Introduction </h2>
                    <p> 
                        Too many times on your life, even more if you are a computer graphics' /
                        videogames' programmer, you end using a Linear interpolation (Usually named LERP).
                        In this short code, you can generate images with <b>N</b> x <b>M</b> resolution by defining 4 colours. 
                        Thoose colours will be positioned on the 4 corner of the image, then the algorithm will fill
                        the rest of the image with a pretty color fade between them.

                    <h2> Code Explanation </h2>
                    <p> 
                        Here a short explanation of what's suposed to do the Code. It's too important
                        to be as clear as posible. Trying to use less words posible, and adding code 
                        to explain the concepts instead of large paragraphs.
